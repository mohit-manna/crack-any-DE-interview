    "### Spark architecture\n",
    "- Spark follows a master-slave architecture with a central Driver and multiple Executors.\n",
    "- The Driver manages the SparkContext, coordinates tasks, and maintains metadata.\n",
    "- Executors run on worker nodes, execute tasks, and store data in memory or disk.\n",
    "- Cluster managers (like YARN, Mesos, or Kubernetes) allocate resources for Spark applications.\n",
    "- Spark supports multiple deployment modes: local, standalone, and on external cluster managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Spark optimizations and scenario based\n",
    "- Use predicate pushdown and column pruning to minimize data read.\n",
    "- Cache/persist intermediate DataFrames when reused multiple times.\n",
    "- Leverage broadcast joins for small lookup tables to avoid shuffles.\n",
    "- Repartition or coalesce DataFrames to optimize parallelism and avoid data skew.\n",
    "- Tune Spark configurations (memory, shuffle partitions, executor cores) based on workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizing your Spark SQL queries\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Partition Pruning:** Use partitioned tables and filter on partition columns to minimize data scanned.\n",
    "2. **Predicate Pushdown:** Ensure filters are pushed down to the data source (like Parquet/ORC) to reduce data read.\n",
    "3. **Column Pruning:** Select only required columns to reduce I/O and memory usage.\n",
    "4. **Broadcast Joins:** Use broadcast joins for small tables to avoid expensive shuffles.\n",
    "5. **Avoid UDFs When Possible:** Prefer built-in Spark SQL functions over UDFs for better performance and optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Broadcasting\n",
    "- Broadcasting sends a small DataFrame to all worker nodes, enabling efficient joins by avoiding shuffles.\n",
    "- Use `broadcast()` in Spark when joining a large table with a much smaller one to optimize performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long running jobs, how you will debug?\n",
    "- Check Spark UI for slow stages, skewed tasks, or failed jobs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Review job DAG and execution plan for bottlenecks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Inspect stage/task metrics for data skew, long task durations, or high shuffle read/write.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Monitor executor and driver logs for errors, GC pauses, or resource issues.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Validate cluster resource allocation (CPU, memory, disk, network).  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensure efficient data partitioning and avoid small files or partitions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Check for excessive shuffles, wide transformations, or large broadcast joins. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Confirm that Spark configurations (memory, cores, partitions) are tuned for the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to check UI for slow stages, skewed tasks, or failed jobs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Open the Spark UI (usually accessible at `http://<driver-node>:4040` during job execution).\n",
    "- Navigate to the **Stages** tab to identify stages with high duration, many failed tasks, or significant skew (uneven task durations).\n",
    "- Use the **Jobs** tab to see job status and failure reasons.\n",
    "- Drill down into individual stages and tasks to inspect metrics like task time, input size, and shuffle read/write.\n",
    "- Check the **Executors** tab for resource usage, task failures, and GC overhead.\n",
    "- Review logs for error messages or stack traces related to failed jobs or tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### If pipelines are running from so long, how you will debug it? what can be potential bottleneck/issues?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analyze Spark UI for slow or stuck stages, long-running tasks, and task failures.\n",
    "- Check for data skew (some partitions processing much more data than others).\n",
    "- Review shuffle operations—excessive shuffling can cause performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "- Inspect resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network) on executors and driver.\n",
    "- Look for frequent garbage collection or out-of-memory errors in logs.\n",
    "- Validate input data size and partitioning; too many or too few partitions can impact performance.\n",
    "- Check for inefficient joins (e.g., missing broadcast joins, large shuffles).\n",
    "- Review code for expensive operations (UDFs, wide transformations, unnecessary caching).\n",
    "- Ensure cluster resources are sufficient and not over-allocated to other jobs.\n",
    "- Investigate external dependencies (slow data sources, network latency, etc.).\n",
    "- Use event logs and metrics to trace where the pipeline is spending most of its time.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Try catch and alert mechanisms implemented in your project , for what purpose do you use them?\n",
    "- In our project, try-catch blocks are used to gracefully handle data ingestion errors, such as malformed records or connectivity issues, ensuring the pipeline continues processing valid data while logging or alerting on failures.\n",
    "- Alert mechanisms (like email, Slack, or monitoring tools) notify the team of job failures, data quality issues, or resource bottlenecks, enabling quick response and minimizing downtime.\n",

    "#### Why does Driver go OOM (Out Of Memory), solutions and preventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causes:**\n",
    "    - Collecting large datasets to the driver using actions like `.collect()`, `.toPandas()`, or `.take()` on big DataFrames/RDDs.\n",
    "    - Accumulating large broadcast variables or driver-side data structures.\n",
    "    - Excessive logging or storing large objects in driver memory.\n",
    "    - High concurrency or too many tasks scheduled at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solutions & Preventions:**\n",
    "    - Avoid collecting large datasets to the driver; use distributed operations and aggregate results before collecting.\n",
    "    - Increase driver memory via `--driver-memory` or `spark.driver.memory` configuration.\n",
    "    - Use `persist()` or `cache()` judiciously to avoid unnecessary memory usage.\n",
    "    - Limit the size of broadcast variables and driver-side data structures.\n",
    "    - Optimize Spark code to minimize driver-side data accumulation.\n",
    "    - Monitor driver memory usage and tune Spark configurations accordingly.\n",
    "    - Use logging levels appropriately to avoid excessive log data in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why does Executor go OOM (Out Of Memory), solutions and preventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causes:**\n",
    "    - Processing partitions that are too large, causing a single executor to exceed its memory limits.\n",
    "    - Inefficient joins (e.g., shuffles, skewed data, or large broadcast joins).\n",
    "    - Caching/persisting large DataFrames/RDDs without enough memory.\n",
    "    - Memory leaks or holding references to large objects in user code.\n",
    "    - Too many concurrent tasks per executor, leading to memory contention.\n",
    "    - Uncompressed or poorly compressed data formats increasing memory usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Solutions & Preventions:**\n",
    "    - Repartition data to ensure partitions are of manageable size.\n",
    "    - Use `persist()`/`cache()` judiciously and unpersist data when no longer needed.\n",
    "    - Tune executor memory (`spark.executor.memory`) and core settings for workload.\n",
    "    - Avoid wide transformations on skewed data; use salting or custom partitioning to balance load.\n",
    "    - Prefer built-in Spark functions over UDFs to reduce memory overhead.\n",
    "    - Monitor executor memory usage and adjust Spark configurations as needed.\n",
    "    - Use efficient data formats (like Parquet/ORC) and enable compression.\n",

    "##### Spark Jobs,stages,tasks and how it is decided how many jobs/stages/tasks will be created of a spark application?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Jobs:** A Spark job is triggered by an action (like `collect()`, `save()`, `count()`) on a DataFrame/RDD. Each action creates a new job.\n",
    "- **Stages:** Each job is divided into stages based on shuffle boundaries. A stage is a set of tasks that can be executed in parallel, separated by wide transformations (like `groupBy`, `join`).\n",
    "- **Tasks:** A stage is split into tasks, one per data partition. Each task processes a single partition of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How are the numbers decided?**\n",
    "- The number of **jobs** equals the number of actions invoked.\n",
    "- The number of **stages** is determined by the number of shuffle boundaries in the job’s DAG. Each wide transformation introduces a new stage.\n",
    "- The number of **tasks** in each stage equals the number of partitions in the input RDD/DataFrame for that stage. Partitioning can be controlled via `repartition()`, `coalesce()`, or data source partitioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary:**  \n",
    "- Actions → Jobs  \n",
    "- Shuffle boundaries → Stages  \n",
    "- Partitions → Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Spark shuffling (sort-merge/hash) \n",
    "- **Shuffling** is the process of redistributing data across partitions, typically required by wide transformations like `groupBy`, `join`, or `distinct`. It is an expensive operation involving disk and network I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sort-Merge Shuffle:** Used for operations like `sortBy` or `sort-merge join`. Data is sorted within each partition and then merged. It is efficient for large datasets but can be slower due to sorting overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hash Shuffle:** Used for hash-based operations like `groupByKey` or `reduceByKey`. Data is assigned to partitions based on a hash function. It is generally faster for smaller datasets but can cause memory pressure and data skew if keys are unevenly distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimizations:**\n",
    "    - Use `reduceByKey` instead of `groupByKey` to minimize data shuffled.\n",
    "    - Tune `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` to control the number of shuffle partitions.\n",
    "    - Prefer broadcast joins for small tables to avoid shuffling large datasets.\n",
    "    - Monitor shuffle read/write metrics in Spark UI to identify bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data skewness - how you will handle it? \n",
    "- **Salting:** Add a random prefix or suffix to skewed keys to distribute data more evenly across partitions, then remove the salt after aggregation.\n",
    "- **Custom Partitioning:** Implement a custom partitioner to control how data is distributed, ensuring skewed keys are spread out.\n",
    "- **Broadcast Join:** Use broadcast joins when one side of the join is small to avoid shuffling large, skewed datasets.\n",
    "- **Skew Join Hints:** Use Spark SQL’s `skew` join hints to handle skewed joins automatically.\n",
    "- **Splitting Skewed Keys:** Process skewed keys separately from the rest of the data, then union the results.\n",
    "- **Increase Shuffle Partitions:** Increase the number of shuffle partitions to reduce the amount of data per partition.\n",
    "- **Filter Outliers:** If possible, filter or pre-aggregate highly skewed keys before the main computation.\n",
